Access to the itch.io website on desktop, Google play store on android or App store on IOS.
Android is preferred over IOS as the app approval process on the IOS app store is tedious and random at best. (Carles Capellas, 2021)
No IDE or secondary software is required nor is text file reading and manipulation as it is already built into the above operating systems.

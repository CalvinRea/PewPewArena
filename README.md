# PewPewArena
PewPewArena is in development so feutures and graphics are constantly changing. Please keep this in mind when wondering why half the code is either out dated or doesn't work as intended :'( Any comments are welcome as improvement is key. I suggest using IntelliJ IDEA when trying to run the game as it is most compatible with the LibGDX framework.
